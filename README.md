PCLiquidations is the leading online retailer of quality refurbished technology for businesses, schools, government organizations, and home users.

Since 1991, we've been transforming the way organizations acquire IT equipment. We specialize in professionally refurbished computers, laptops, monitors, business phone systems, servers, networking, and printers that deliver enterprise-grade performance at a fraction of the cost of new equipment. Our extensive inventory includes over 3,000 models from trusted brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, Poly, Panasonic, and Yealink.

At PCLiquidations, we make technology accessible and affordable. Every product undergoes our rigorous refurbishment process. Our certified technicians test, repair, and restore each item to meet manufacturer specifications. We then back everything with up to a one-year warranty. This commitment to quality has earned us over 250,000 satisfied customers and consistently high ratings across review platforms.

We serve diverse sectors including education, healthcare, government, and small to medium businesses. Our clients trust us with large IT refresh orders and individual purchases alike. We understand that every organization has unique technology needs. That's why we offer customization options like custom imaged computers, IP Phone Provisioning, RAM upgrades, SSD installations, and pre-configured Windows operating systems.

Beyond selling refurbished equipment, we're committed to environmental responsibility. We provide comprehensive IT asset disposition (ITAD) services to help organizations securely retire their old technology. Our data destruction processes protect sensitive information while our recycling programs keep electronics out of landfills. We believe in the circular economy where technology gets a second life rather than becoming e-waste.

Our Jacksonville, Florida headquarters houses a state-of-the-art 55,000+ square foot distribution center. From here, we ship worldwide and offer free shipping on online orders over $500. Our highly rated customer service team is available via chat, email, or phone to provide expert guidance and help you find the right technology solutions for your needs.
